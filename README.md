## about

I am a low-level programmer focused on operating system development and
computer architecture.

My interests include:
- kernel development from scratch
- bare-metal and hardware-level programming
- PCI, interrupts, DMA
- CPU and virtual machine emulation
- understanding systems from silicon to software

Most projects are written in C and x86 assembly.
